                        Europe's Competition Commission has long taken a dim view of tech companies abusing their
                        dominant position to stifle rivals, but this has been a particularly bad week for US tech giants
                        in Europe. One day after announcing an investigation into Amazon, the EU handed a 242 million
                        euro ($272 million) fine to chipmaker Qualcomm for lowering the price of its 3G chipsets to
                        force its competitors out of the market. In the era of 5G, it may seem odd that the EU is still
                        looking back at 3G chipsets (and issues that occurred between 2009 and 2011), but Qualcomm has
                        been under investigation for four years. The Commission said that Qualcomm forced one
                        competitor, a company called Icera out of the market, which could potentially have stifled
                        innovation.

                        Many people, even some diehard Android fans, are still under the impression that Samsung
                        smartwatches are only for Samsung phones. That’s simply not true, and in many ways, they work
                        better than watches with Google’s own Wear OS. One of the things that isn’t better is Bixby.
                        Thankfully, the ever-resourceful XDA community has come through again. It’s now possible to get
                        Google Assistant on a number of Samsung watches. Google Assistant on Samsung watches has been a
                        highly requested feature for a long time. There have been a few attempts to bring Assistant to
                        these watches, but nothing easy or reliable has ever come from them. XDA Senior Member
                        Cybernetic87 took matters into their own hands and now we have a solution that is easy to set up
                        and works extremely well.

                        The eighth-generation 2020 Chevrolet Corvette is finally here. Rocking a brand-new shape and
                        posting some impressive acceleration figures, even the base model of the C8 Corvette looks to be
                        an absolute riot. But this is only the start of Corvette Fever, and a new report suggests future
                        variants of C8 might get some new-age tech. Chevrolet has already said the C8 Corvette is
                        designed with potential electrification in mind, but at the launch of the 2020 Corvette, Autocar
                        asked a member of the Chevy team if it would be obscene to assume that an electrified Corvette
                        might sport a mild-hybrid powertrain or use a front-axle electric motor to add all-wheel drive.
                        The response was pretty telling: "You would not look stupid if you said that," Autocar reports
                        the Corvette team member saying.

                        One of the hardest aspects of maintaining a cross-platform product is ensuring its security.
                        Vulnerabilities can be exploited on various platforms in various scenarios, and it’s almost
                        impossible for literally any company’s security department to fix all of them on their own.
                        That’s why companies often use vulnerability disclosure rewards programs, which basically means
                        giving money to someone who finds an issue in your product. Google has several programs of this
                        kind. One of them is the Chrome Vulnerability Rewards Program, which awards security researchers
                        for exploiting vulnerabilities in Chromium, Chrome, and Chrome OS. As you already know, there
                        are a lot of Chromium-based browsers on the market, so the security of this product is crucial.
